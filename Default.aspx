                        Amity is best defined as friendship among nations and Perpetual Amity Furnishings & Travel, Inc, NFP exists to build

international friendships by providing a better learning and living environment for international students and visiting 

scholars from foreign countries attending American colleges and universities. You can check the website link for 

participating schools. We also schedule trips around the United States to give students and scholars a visible imprint 

of life in America. Perpetual Amity is a Christian faith based Non-For-Profit organization using biblical principles as 

our guide to insure we break barriers and build bridges of friendship with people from all nations. We are often asked 

why we help international students the way we do and the answers are simple, God loves everyone and gave Himself 

for everyone and we are to do likewise. Jesus said in Matthew 25:35-40, “For I was hungry and you gave me food, I 

was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, sick and you visited me … as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.” Secondly, we want 

international students to know that Americans are a generous, supportive and caring people. Third, that America is

beautiful.

        ﻿<p>The management of Perpetual Amity has over 20 years experience engaging international students at Northern Illinois University by meeting their physical needs and showing them the marvels of America, its scenery and its people. Each year the number of students served by our organization grows in number. What began as a small ministry project of Sycamore Baptist Church is now a company with as many as 35 volunteers each semester, serving 300 plus students each year. Our goal is to see that every international student attending NIU has an adequate study and living environment. All the furniture is donated by individuals and corporations. We have received such significant donations we now use a 26,000 square foot storage facility and are making plans to purchase it. During 2014, we will begin meeting the needs of international students in other universities located within northern Illinois. It is important for you to know that no one associated with Perpetual Amity receives compensation; it is completely operated by students, scholars, faculty, and community partners who volunteer their time, talents, and energies. Perpetual Amity is a Non-For-Profit corporation governed by a board of directors which includes people from the community and international students. There is a need for financial donations to cover the cost of storage and transportation so until we receive our 501C status, you may send your tax deductable donations to Sycamore Baptist Church, PO Box 367, Sycamore, IL 60178. The photos shown in each gallery will give you a feel for who we are and how Perpetual Amity is dependent upon its many volunteers from all around the world and the local community. We would love the opportunity to share with individuals or groups the many stories behind Perpetual Amity Furnishings & Travel, Inc. so feel free to make an appointment with president and founder Dan Stovall (dan@perpetualamity.org).</p>
